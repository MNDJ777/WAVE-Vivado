1) Enable nested interrupts.

xscugic_intr.c

/*
* If pre-eption is required:
* Re-enable pre-emption by setting the CPSR I bit for non-secure ,
* interrupts or the F bit for secure interrupts
*/

__asm("MSR DAIFClr, #2");

/*
* If we need to change security domains, issue a SMC
* instruction here.
*/

/*
* Execute the ISR. Jump into the Interrupt service routine
* based on the IRQSource. A software trigger is cleared by
*.the ACK.
*/
TablePtr = &(InstancePtr->Config->HandlerTable[InterruptID]);
if (TablePtr != NULL) {
	TablePtr->Handler(TablePtr->CallBackRef);
}

__asm("MSR DAIFSet, #2");

2) Don't assign BAR address during PCIe init.

xdmapcie.c

/*
* Write Address to PCIe BAR
*/
/*
Ret = XDmaPcie_AllocBarSpace(
	InstancePtr, PCIeHeaderType,
	BusNum, PCIeDevNum,
	PCIeFunNum);
if (Ret != 0)
	return;
*/
