# WAVE-Vivado
HDL and C source for wavelet-based CMV12000 video compression on a Zynq Ultrascale+ SoC. For reference only - there isn't enough here to create a project from scratch!

**Note:** This repository is no longer maintained. For just the lightweight NVMe driver, there is a newer repository that includes project creation scripts for Vivado 2021.1 and addresses some minor issues: https://github.com/coltonshane/SSD_Test.
